This product is not affiliated with Favic-o-Matic or their fine products. However, recent updates would not be possible without their amazing Ultimate Favicon Generator and their favic-o-meter.

Favic-o-Matic generates favicons, both .ico & .png (even transparent ones!), and the HTML code needed to make your website look awesome on every browser and every device.
